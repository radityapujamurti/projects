excerpt: Monitor Stock Price With Python and Streamlit
---

Creating a web app using Python becomes enjoyable, thanks to Streamlit. In this project, I created a web app that downloads ticker data from Yahoo Finance and displayed the price on a candle chart with the help of Plotly library.

This project is a part of a series of [YouTube tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnrBXTksiuOPzyDlXvLBlFg) that I created. The intention is to share my knowledge and add more programming tutorial videos for my Indonesian friends thus the language is in Bahasa Indonesia.

Cheers! ðŸš€
